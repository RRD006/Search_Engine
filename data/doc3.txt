An Inverted Index is a data structure used in information retrieval systems to efficiently retrieve documents or web pages containing a specific term or set of terms. In an inverted index, the index is organized by terms (words), and each term points to a list of documents or web pages that contain that term.
An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. In simple words, it is a hashmap-like data structure that directs you from a word to a document or a web page. They are especially useful for large collections of documents, where searching through all the documents would be prohibitively slow.
To search for documents containing a particular term or set of terms, the search engine queries the inverted index for those terms and retrieves the list of documents associated with each term. The search engine can then use this information to rank the documents based on relevance to the query and present them to the user in order of importance.
