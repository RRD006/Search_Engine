Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used. 
Hash data structures are a fundamental building block of computer science and are used in a wide range of applications such as databases, caches, and programming languages. They are a way to map data of any type, called keys, to a specific location in memory called a bucket. These data structures are incredibly fast and efficient, making them a great choice for large and complex data sets.
hash data structure is a type of data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements. It is often used to implement associative arrays or mappings, which are data structures that allow you to store a collection of key-value pairs.
In a hash data structure, elements are stored in an array, and each element is associated with a unique key. To store an element in a hash, a hash function is applied to the key to generate an index into the array where the element will be stored. The hash function should be designed such that it distributes the elements evenly across the array, minimizing collisions where multiple elements are assigned to the same index.
