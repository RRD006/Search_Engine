Information Retrieval (IR) helps to find relevant information from large collections of documents. It can be defined as a software program that deals with the organization, storage, retrieval and evaluation of information from documents. It is like a smart librarian who doesn’t give you direct answers but tells you where to find the right book like this IR system scans them and pulls out the ones that match your query.
When you search for something Information Retrieval (IR) model helps find the most relevant documents and ranks them based on your query. It works by comparing your query with documents in the system using a matching function. This function gives each document a retrieval status value (RSV) which helps rank the most relevant results first. To do this IR systems represent documents using descriptors i.e most important keywords from vocabulary (V).
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance.
An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.[2]
Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,[3] audio,[4] mind maps[5] or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.
