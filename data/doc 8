Utility-based agents extend goal-based thinking by evaluating actions based on how well they maximize a utility function—essentially a measure of "happiness" or "satisfaction." This approach allows them to make nuanced trade-offs between competing goals or uncertain outcomes.
Learning agents improve their performance over time based on experience. They modify their behavior by observing the consequences of their actions, adjusting their internal models and decision-making approaches to achieve better outcomes in future interactions.
Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous agents that interact with each other within an environment. These agents may cooperate toward common goals, compete for resources or exhibit a mix of cooperative and competitive behaviors
Hierarchical agents organize decision-making across multiple levels, with high-level agents making strategic decisions and delegating specific tasks to lower-level agents. This structure mirrors many human organizations and allows for managing problems at appropriate levels of abstraction.
Agents are used in a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence, including:

Robotics: Agents can be used to control robots and automate tasks in manufacturing, transportation and other industries.
Smart homes and buildings: They can be used to control heating, lighting and other systems in smart homes and buildings, optimizing energy use and improving comfort.
Healthcare: They can be used to monitor patients, provide personalized treatment plans and optimize healthcare resource allocation.
Finance: They can be used for automated trading, fraud detection and risk management in the financial industry.
Games: They can be used to create intelligent opponents in games and simulations, providing a more challenging and realistic experience for players.
