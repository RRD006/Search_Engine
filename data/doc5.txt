The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
Data structures provide an easy way of organising, retrieving, managing, and storing data.
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links. 

A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL.
A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree following the additional properties: 

The left part of the root node contains keys less than the root node key.
The right part of the root node contains keys greater than the root node key.
There is no duplicate key present in the binary tree.
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types: 

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
